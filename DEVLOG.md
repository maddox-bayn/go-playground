# Week 1 – Day 1 Reflection

Today I worked on 3 string utilities in Go:

1. **Reverse string** – Learned how to handle Unicode by converting strings to `[]rune` before reversing.
2. **Palindrome check** – Understood the importance of comparing runes from both ends, not just bytes.
3. **Character count** – Used a map to count rune frequency. This helped me see how maps store key-value pairs efficiently.

## Key Learnings
- Strings in Go are immutable; to manipulate them, I had to convert them to `[]rune`.
- Tests are powerful: they caught mistakes immediately.
- Using `git add`, `commit`, and `push` makes my work visible on GitHub (public proof).

## Next Step
Tomorrow I’ll explore **runes vs strings** more deeply, with utility functions and tests.
